# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an inquisitive Junior Software Engineer where I like to use my passion for technology to improve quality of life. You'll find me keeping up with the latest technology trends and in my spare time indulging my love of gaming, motorsport & martial arts.

I have a 2:1 Honours Degree in Mathematics, a Web & App Development Diploma from RED Academy and currently completing a Computing & IT degree at the Open University.

I have a thirst for knowledge, I'm passionate about everything I do and this shows in the quality of work I provide. I find and implement new ways to show results & to initiate new ideas.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving Jesey to become the top student mental health app
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TypeScript & Python
